    <p class="Quation1">1A. What need did you identify? Why was addressing this need important to you? Minimum 100 words*</p>
    <p class="Answer">I'm currently working on creating an educational app for kids in a very systematic way. The educational system in my country is lacking, and I want to provide a fun and engaging way for kids to learn. The app will start with a "Learn How To Learn" course, which will be tailored to the understanding of kids. Following that, they will learn English, and eventually programming languages based on their interests. The app will also include a conversation feature that will allow kids to help each other and earn strength points in the process. My plan is to make the app a game, so the kids won't even realize that they're learning. At the end of the game, the winner will be tested on what they've learned and the projects they've designed. Based on their age, they will receive a prize or scholarship as a reward for their hard work.</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1B. What specific actions did you take to address the need? If your initiative is unfinished, what actions do you still plan to take? Minimum 150 words*</p>
    <p class="Answer">I am currently working on improving my programming skills in Python, as well as my English and commerce expertise. Now I'm learning about user interfaces (UI/UX) and how making them more attractive to children. I believe that by incorporating fun colors, clear explanations, and popular games, children will be more engaged and able to benefit the most from the application.
        In order to expand the reach of the application, I plan to build relationships with schools and universities. I believe that by partnering with these institutions, we can recognize the certificate of completion from the application as a sign of true proficiency in language and programming skills. This app will be in the easiest way for children to use and will provide them with the most benefit. I believe that whoever can complete this program has a high level of intelligence, as it will require learning a new language, programming in various branches, and gaining knowledge in commerce alongside peers.</p>

    <p class="Quation">1C. Whether it is finished or unfinished, how do you measure the success of the initiative? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">Based on statistical data, it is highly likely that this application will be successful due to its focus on key educational components that will benefit future generations and help develop their cognitive abilities. Specifically, the application emphasizes teaching children how to learn, as well as providing instruction in programming and the English language. Furthermore, as the application is still in development, there will be many additional features and resources added in the future to further enhance its effectiveness. By regularly using this application, children will gain a significant amount of experience and knowledge, which will ultimately give them a valuable edge over their peers.</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1D. What difficulties did you encounter? Were you able to overcome them and how? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">I faced some difficulties with my English language course, which was mostly due to my own mistakes and negligence. However, I was determined to learn and applied for a scholarship to improve my skills. By working a lot, my level of English has improved significantly, although I still have room to grow. I also encountered some challenges in programming, but I realized that my distractions were causing me to lose focus. I decided to become more committed to my programming work, and I am now working on creating the app I have always dreamed of. Despite the obstacles I have faced, I remain optimistic about my ability to develop and grow, especially since I am still in the prime of my youth.</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">1E. What one lesson did you learn from this experience? What one thing would you do differently if you were to address the need again? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">I used to think that the idea of everything working out in the end was just a myth. But then something happened to me that made me realize that every challenge we face is just an opportunity for a new, better ending. I've learned that I shouldn't despair because God always has our best interests in mind, even when things don't seem to be going our way. If back, I wouldn't waste my time feeling sad over something I lost. I've decided to keep moving forward with my life and never give up, no matter what obstacles come my way.</p>

    <p class="Quation">2A. Who is a leader, past or present, in your local or the global community, that you find inspiring? Which of their achievements inspire you? Minimum 75 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">Jim Kwik, he is a brain coach who taught me how to memorize a lot of things without forgetting them. His teaching methods were so effective that I was able to study for only a few hours a day. Not only that, but I also learned from him how to read quickly, which has helped me tremendously in my studies and in life in general when it comes to reading books. Thanks to him, I now have more time to spend with my family while still good in my academics.</p>
      <hr>
    <p class="Quation">2B. How has this leader shaped your definition of leadership? What is one specific behavior you have adopted because of this leader? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer"> He shared that he had experienced a life-changing accident when he was young that took away his ability to read and remember things. Unfortunately, this led to him being bullied by others because of his condition. However, he didn't let that stop him from persevering and learning how to remember things easily and read quickly. Thanks to him, I too am learning how to improve my memory and language skills effortlessly. I appreciate his inspiring story because it helps me to stay motivated and not worry about what others may think. Despite being called hurtful names like "broken mind," he was able to become a successful brain coach, I like his way in proving himself</p>

    <p class="Quation">2C. Leaders make mistakes too. Consider one this leader has made and explain what you will do differently from them? Minimum 100 words *</p>
    <p class="Answer">I'm Still Working On It</p>
        <hr>
    <p class="Quation">3A. Why did you select this piece of work? *</p>
    <p class="Answer"> When I draw, it's like I'm transported to a peaceful, solitary world where nothing else exists. It's a place where I can pour out my thoughts and feelings onto paper, and it's incredibly calming and soothing. Drawing has helped me express things that are difficult to put into words, and it's taught me so much. I've become really adept at using my pen and I've even learned to write with both hands. Plus, I've started to experiment with drawing with both hands too, which has been really fun and challenging. All in all, drawing has been an amazing outlet for me, and I'm so grateful for it. I really cannot express how much learning to draw has helped me. It has been such a positive experience and I am truly grateful for it. Without it, I think I would feel a bit lost and maybe even lonely. But now, I have this wonderful hobby that brings me so much joy and fulfillment. It's amazing what a difference it can make to have a creative outlet like this.</p>
      <hr>
    <p class="Quation">3B. How have you built, or will you build, on your chosen piece of work? *</p>
    <p class="Answer">I have a passion for creating comic stories that have a purpose, but I realize that my drawing skills need improvement before I can bring those stories to life. I plan to focus on practicing and developing my drawing abilities until I feel confident that I can produce quality work. Only then will I consider pursuing my dream of making purposeful comic stories.</p>

    <p class="Quation">1. Please list the two most important awards, either academic or extracurricular, that you have won below. You may attach documentation as proof, if available. Please ensure your information includes the year of your award and the awarding organization. Uploading documentation is not required.*</p>
    <p class="Answer">I've had some prior experiences in different activities, like karate, although I couldn't continue it due to my father's refusing to have his daughter participate in a martial sport. Nevertheless, I managed to earn a yellow belt for beginners, along with a certificate and a bronze medal. Additionally, I was a member of the church scout team, a commitment I've held since my second-grade year in primary school up until my third year of preparatory school. We had a lot of fantastic and enjoyable activities to do there.</p>
